# What is tictactoe-ai?
This is a python implementation of the minimax algorithm on a tictactoe board.

# How do I use it?
Just run 'main.py'.

# How big can I make the board?
As big as you want. But even on 4 x 4 boards, the minimax algorithm doesn't seem to run fast enough on python.
Even with alpha-beta pruning implemented. So on larger boards, you will have to decrease the search depth, which will
result in worse play from the ai.
